# Fauna sample schemas and data sets

This repository contains sample schemas and data sets for use with [Fauna](https://www.fauna.com/) database.

Sample data sets are sorted by use case, e.g. `ecommerce`, `blog`, `social`, etc. and then by name. Schema files are in Fauna Schema Language (FSL) format and data sets for those schemas are in JSON format.
