# Fauna sample schemas and data sets

This repository contains sample schemas and data sets for use with [Fauna](https://www.fauna.com/) database.

Sample data sets are sorted by use case, e.g. `ecommerce`, `blog`, `social`, etc. and then by name. Schema files are in Fauna Schema Language (FSL) format and data sets for those schemas are in JSON format.

For each use case, there is a directory per demo data set. Inside of that directory will be a `schema` directory and a `data` directory. The schema directory will contain the schema files in Fauna Schema Language (FSL) format and the data directory will contain the Fauna Query Language (FQL) files to generate the demo data sets.
